To test if this multichannel was working properly, I set up various clients and connected them to the server each with
different channels posting messages.

subscribers to ALL:     received messages from everyone and posted only to ALL
subscribers to RANDOM:  received messages from RANDOM and posted only to RANDOM
subscribers to MPCS:    received messages from MPCS and posted only to MPCS

Can also open each pickle file and see messages stored only for those subscribers.
